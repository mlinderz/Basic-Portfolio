    <p> Hello and welcome to my online portfolio! My name is Melinda Santana and I am an aspiriing web developer in San Francisco.
    <br> I currently work as a Project Coordinator for Facebook's Remote Site Engineering team providing technical program managment
    <br>team support. I currently work to maintain and monitor project plans, schedules, work hours, budgets and expenditures to
    <br>ensure that project adhere to established timelines and documentation is matinated appropriately on a day-to-day basis.
    <br>Prior to my current position, I spent 6 years working as a paralegal in various field including but not limited to immigration,
    <br>litigation and estates and trusts. After a brief foray to explore my legal dreams in law school - I quickly realized that the 
    <br>legal field was not for me.
    </p>
    
    <p>Feel free to take a look around and see what I've been up to while taking Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. While I'm happy at my 
    <br>current job, I'm taking coding to spread my wings and get more creative control of my career path. Feel free to reach out 
    <br> to reach out to me via the contact page with any questions you may have!
